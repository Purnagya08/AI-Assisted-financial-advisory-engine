# 🧠 AI Assisted Financial Advisory Engine

## 📌 Overview

The **AI Assisted Financial Advisory Engine** is a decision-support platform designed to help Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) evaluate their financial health and loan readiness using real operational cashflow data instead of traditional credit-only metrics.

Small businesses are frequently denied loans because legacy credit systems rely heavily on bureau scores, collateral, and historical borrowing records. Many MSMEs lack these formal signals but operate with active digital payments, GST transactions, and ongoing business revenue.

This system analyzes real financial inputs and generates a transparent, explainable advisory report that helps businesses understand:

* Their financial stability
* Their borrowing risk level
* A sustainable loan amount
* Practical steps to improve eligibility

The platform acts as a **pre-loan financial intelligence layer**, not a banking replacement.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional lending models often fail MSMEs because:

* Thin or missing credit history leads to automatic rejection
* Seasonal revenue patterns are misclassified as instability
* Cash-based or digital-first businesses lack structured balance sheets
* Borrowers rarely receive explanations or sustainability analysis

This creates a credit-access gap and increases dependence on high-interest informal lending.

## 💡 Solution

The AI Assisted Financial Advisory Engine combines deterministic financial modeling with AI-generated reasoning.

After entering business financial data, the system:

1. Calculates key financial ratios
2. Computes a rule-based risk score
3. Assigns a loan eligibility category
4. Estimates a safe borrowing amount
5. Generates a clear explanation of financial strengths and risks

This ensures both **numerical reliability** and **human-readable transparency**.
